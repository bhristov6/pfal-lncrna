I followed up on the lnc13 motif that seemed very interesting with the help of Tim Bailey. We looked at the sequences from the top 25% of the peaks as well as the bottom 75%:

* the motif is enriched in both sets, importantly it is more enriched in the top 25% of sequences than in the bottom 75% which is what we expected/hoped for
* the motif typically appears several times in a sequence- it is repetitive
* the motif is present in the lnc13 linear sequence in two repetitive blocks
* the motif could be found in the pfal genome (in a 10000 randomly drawn sequences it was found 340 times) typically in repeated blocks


Clearly, the motif is enriched in the lncRNA peak sequences  (and more heavily in the top sequences). Its repetitive nature gives me a pause though.

From each peak extracted 100bp sequence centered at the peak summit. Provided the list of sequences to https://meme-suite.org/ using the STREME tool with default parameters. Results are online and available through these urls:
