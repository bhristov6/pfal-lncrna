Motif Discovery

We extracted all 100b sequences centered at the peaksâ€™ summits and used the STREME tool [ref1] to search for possible motifs in the lncRNA binding areas. We identified one motif for lnc13 (fig M1, pval=1.8e-3) occurring multiple times in 131 of the 138 (95%) lnc13 sequences. In contrast, the same motif was found in 324 of 10000 (0.3%) randomly drawn sequences. We further examined the set of 413 filtered out lnc13 peaks which we suspected are mostly false positives but may still contain real peaks. Indeed, while the motif was enriched in this set (pval=4e-2, occurring in 31% of the sequences) the enrichment was less than that in our confident set of lnc13 peaks. For TARE, we identified two possible motifs, figures M2 and M3, pvals= 3.7e-6, 5.1e-5, occurring in 72% and 61% of the TARE binding areas.
