No interesting or significant results here.

For each peak we examined a 2000b window around its summit (x-axis centered at the peak summit at 0) and averaged the histone values (Z-score of the Histone logfold change over the input, y-axis) for each position in the window. Different panels correspond to different time points; missing panels correspond to missing data for that particular time point. 

There are two flavors of the plot:

1) Heatmap. Includes all the peaks not just the top peaks. Peaks are sorted with the tallest peaks being on top. The color indicates the Z-score of the logfold change. Clearly present in the top middle (summit region for the top peaks) is strong signal for several marks. As we go down the y-axis including less reliable peaks the signal disappears.

2) A more compact version of the heatmap is showing the average of the histone change as a black line and one standard deviation as red shade. Important difference: for this plot only the top 25% of the peaks are used in the calculation of the average to emphasize the change of signal near the summit while the heatmap shows all peaks to emphasize the stronger signal for the top peaks.

Heatmaps take longer to generate and I included only a few. If all are needed I will be happy to generate them.
