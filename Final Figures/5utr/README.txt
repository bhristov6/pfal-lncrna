LncRNA peaks primarily overlap with 5'UTR flank of genes.

For a given lncRNA of interest we examined what regions of the genome each of its peaks overlaps. We extended a 1000bp window from the 5' and 3' end of the nearest gene to the each peak. We aggregated these genomic windows together with the gene body normalized to 1000b in order to account for for different gene lengths into 3000b window (x-axis). For each base position we plotted the density (the number of peaks overlapping the respective position divided by the total number of peaks) on the y-axis.
