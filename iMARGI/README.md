# iMARGI

The paper describing the iMARGI-seq protocol is here [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/681924v1.full.pdf). I ran manually the scripts from the Docker container provided by the paper's authors. 


I downloaded the data iMARGI data Trevor sent me (total of 5 pair-end experiments) into [~proj/Data/LeRochLab/iMARGI](~proj/Data/LeRochLab/iMARGI). Working on getting the scripts to run bug free.

## Basic statistics.

| experiment | total reads | cleaned | % | mapped | % | after removing duplicates | % | after filter proximal | % | trans-contacts % |
