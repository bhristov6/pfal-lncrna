## 1. Barcodes demultiplexing and summary statistics

In this table, all previously generated by Trevor RADICL-seq data is aggregated in the first row (regardless of barcode). It is followed by the latest patch from August, segregated by barcode. The majority of reads (85%) from the most recent data don't contain a full barcode leaving only a handful of valid read pairs for downstream analysis per barcode. The exception is **TTCTTC** which yields many final pairs (48% of all final pairs). When the barcode is present the bridge is found in 11% of the reads (improvement over 9% in previous runs) but when the barcode is absent the bridge is found in only 3% of the reads. PCR duplicates have been removed. However, when the final valid read pairs are counted the multi-mappers are counted separately, that is for example, if a RNA-tag corresponding to TARE has its DNA-tag mapped to 7 different locations then I will count 7 RNA-DNA final pairs instead of 1. I will generate a table where the count is always 1 reflective of the fact we have only 1 RNA tag.


| barcode           | % in all reads | having the bridge | % in final pairs | num valid final pairs | cis proximal (<1kb) | cis distal | trans-contacts |
| :---------------: | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |   ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | 
| **Aggregated**    | -              |  between 1% to %9 | 100% | 3,213,988 | 0.3% | 7.6% | 92.1% |

## 2. Heatmaps

This is a Hi-C style heatmap of all final valid pairs in a given dataset. The x-axis is the DNA genomic axes, and the y-axis is the RNA one. I generate .mcool files which can be easily visualized by [Higlass](https://higlass.io/). Below is a static snapshot image, I will try to embed the interactive one with mouse zoom in/out. In the meantime the .mcool files are in [files](files/) directory.

There are a couple of prominent horizontal lines that I would like to follow up on. I will send their locations to Trevor and also check if they match the ones we saw in iMARGI data. This will be very interesting.

#### Per Barcode (Newest August):

We have very few reads per barcode in some cases.

## 3. TARE mappings

Here is our favorite positive control. All reads (multi-mappers) corresponding to TARE have been aggregated in the genomic plots below. While there is noise, the peaks with more than 5 reads are at the telomere regions indicating that the experiment has worked! This is true for both the Aggregated data as well as the latest August patch.

## 4. Other lncRNAs


(I am expanding this section... ) 
First, this is a histogram showing the number of final read pairs that I have for each of the known lncRNAs. For a decent number of them I have more than 200 (TARE has 220) read pairs I can use to investigate their biding pattern.

For those with the most reads, here are their genomic tracks:
