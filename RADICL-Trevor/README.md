## 1. Barcodes demultiplexing and summary statistics

In this table, all previously generated by Trevor RADICL-seq data is aggregated in the first row (regardless of barcode). It is followed by the latest patch from August, segregated by barcode. The majority of reads (85%) from the most recent data don't contain a full barcode leaving only a handful of valid read pairs for downstream analysis per barcode. The exception is **TTCTTC** which yields many final pairs (48% of all final pairs). When the barcode is present the bridge is found in 11% of the reads (improvement over 9% in previous runs) but when the barcode is absent the bridge is found in only 3% of the reads. PCR duplicates have been removed. However, when the final valid read pairs are counted the multi-mappers are counted separately, that is for example, if a RNA-tag corresponding to TARE has its DNA-tag mapped to 7 different locations then I will count 7 RNA-DNA final pairs instead of 1. I will generate a table where the count is always 1 reflective of the fact we have only 1 RNA tag.

## 2. Heatmaps

This is a Hi-C style heatmap of all final valid pairs in a given dataset. The x-axis is the DNA genomic axes, and the y-axis is the RNA one. I generate .mcool files which can be easily visualized by [Higlass](https://higlass.io/). Below is a static snapshot image, I will try to embed the interactive one. In the meantime the .mcool files are in [files](files/) directory.
